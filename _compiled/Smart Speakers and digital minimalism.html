  <p><h1>Smart Speakers and digital minimalism</h1>

</p>
<p>Note: This post is neither sponsored nor affiliated with any company</p>
<p>Over the past few years, digital minimalism has taken flight and become something of a radical shift in the way many people look at technology. Along with this, comes a huge number of "gurus" preaching everything from getting a basic flip phone, using post, removing every application or just not using a phone at all.
I don't know about you, but being a computer guy, these are unattainable goals. But, this post is about something else that has been a rather interesting finding. 
But getting a digital product while also advocating digital minimalism? Nice joke isn't it? Let me explain.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-this-smart-speaker">What is this "smart" speaker</h1>
<p>I believe most of you have heard of Siri, Alexa or Google assistant by now. If not, essentially they are digital assistants that connect to the internet and using that, can do some basic tasks for you, fetch information or have a basic conversation with you. Almost every phone these days has one inbuilt with it. If that sounds a little creepy to you, well yes. It is. But the smart speakers have something that phones purposely make hard to find - a mute the mic button. 
Oh also, I only refer to the ones that do not have displays. The ones that do defeat the whole point. (I have a Google Nest mini. And no this is not sponsored or anything. That was the cheapest one I could find near me.)
Well why would you want to use one of these?</p>
<h1 id="a-reasonable-goal">A reasonable goal</h1>
<p>We all know that getting rid of your phone altogether does not work for everyone. I rely on it for a lot of things that are important to me. In fact, let's make a little list of tasks that I generally use my phone for.
- Calling people
- Setting alarms, timers
- Listening to music while constantly skipping to the next track
- Looking at the time when I randomly wake up at 3am
- The weather
- Randomly having the urge to learn about a topic
- Find restaurants around me
- Random calculations (200C to F?? Guess I should have paid more attention in school)
- My calendar</p>
<p>Sheesh, talk about dependancy.</p>
<h1 id="find-the-pattern">Find the pattern!</h1>
<p>My day job is looking at data. And things like this trigger that part of me that wants to analyze something. But even if you don't care about all that, if you look at that list again you will notice something rather interesting. Most of the task on that list are actually things that take a couple of minutes or seconds even. What about music you ask? Yes I have something playing almost the whole day. 
What happens is that we pick up our phones to look at the time, or skip the current track, or even googling what the capital of Venezuela is (Caracas. Yes I looked it up. Don't judge.) and then, the "magic" that is technology shows us a cute puppy or a tiny little pop up tells us that hey remember that selfie you posted a few days ago? You have 150 likes on it. (Atleast my friends get those). And then oh no, I have been scrolling instagram for the past 3 hours? Wait. What happened to lunch. Oh no, when was the last time I used the washroom? 
Oops.</p>
<p>Kinda scary what a couple of seconds can do isn't it?</p>
<h1 id="smart-speakers-to-the-rescue">Smart speakers to the rescue?</h1>
<p>If you can't get rid of everything, you find out things that have the most bang for your buck right? 
So how do they help exactly? Well imagine you have one lying around somewhere. Unlike your phone, you do not have to reach out for it. You could just say "Hey <Alexa/Google assistant blah blah> and whatever you want. Saving you from the rabbit hole rather easily infact. As long as you keep your phone out of reach and you are actually doing something else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling people : Hey <Google/Alexa> , call my mom. (yes you can save nicknames)</li>
<li>Alarm/Timer: Hey <Google/Alexa>, set an/a alarm/timer for 10 mins/8am everyday.</li>
<li>Listening to music while constantly skipping to the next track : Hey <Google/Alexa> , next song or shuffle Coldplay.</li>
<li>Looking at the time when I randomly wake up at 3am. Hey <Google/Alexa> , what's the time? Or even what year is it?</li>
<li>The weather: Hey <Google/Alexa>, will it rain?</li>
<li>Randomly having the urge to learn about a topic: Hey <Google/Alexa>, what is the capital of Venezuela?</li>
<li>Find restaurants around me: Hey <Google/Alexa>, chinese food near me?</li>
<li>Random calculations (200C to F?? Guess I should have paid more attention in school): Hey <Google/Alexa>, 200C to F?</li>
<li>My calendar: Hey <Google/Alexa>, create a calendar event. Get flowers. 4pm.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is just the tip of the iceberg. As these things get more advanced, you can do things like booking appointments as well.
Seems like a nice way to not start scrolling Twitter feeds when you just turned off your morning alarm right?</p>
<h1 id="i-do-not-have-that-kind-of-money">I do not have that kind of money</h1>
<p>Understandable. These things are rather expensive. But there are two options for you.
1. Get the cheaper one. Honestly, the only drawback being you might need to scream a little louder.
2. Have an old spare phone lying around? Get one of these assistants, turn off the auto lock, keep it connected to the charger. Enable the listen to Hey Google/Alexa/Siri. And you are done. 
3. If you are a bit more technically inclined, make your own!

<p>As a side note, I got my Google Nest mini for 32 euros. I can't say it was cheap but there are cheaper options of course. </p>
<h1 id="a-perfect-solution">A perfect solution?</h1>
<p>Well. No. Nothing is perfect. You could still end up down the rabbit hole. But it does stop you from doing that as often. With time, I can say that I have definitely stopped looking at my phone that often. Most of the things that would usually distract me are taken care of by using the speaker. That does not mean I never end up watching Youtube videos about fluffy cheesecakes at 2am sometimes, but it does mean that I do not fall into the loop when all I wanted to do was play Ed Sheeran instead.
And like a lot of things in life, this depends on you too. Do you want to do this? Or are you just following the hype?</p>
