<p><strong>[31]</strong> Computational Limits (Just notes)
- Thompson, N. C., Greenewald, K., Lee, K., &amp; Manso, G. F. (2020). The Computational Limits of Deep Learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.05558. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05558">Paper</a></p>

<li>Deep learning is quickly becoming unsustainable economically, environmentally and technically</li>
<li>deep learning might soon become computationally constrained even though substantial improvements might be possible</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="theory">theory</h1>
<ul>
<li>over parameterizing a neural network basically means that it would be given more parameters and there are data points</li>
<li>a cost of training the neural network scales with the product of the number of parameters with the number of data points</li>
<li>theoretically, It grows by at least the square of the number of data points in an over parameterized setting</li>
<li>we should always be aware of a performance plateau</li>
<li>as the amount of data increases, standard flexible models are performed expert models because they do not capture all the contributing factors</li>
<li>traditional machine learning techniques to better when data is small and deep learning does better when there's a huge amount of data. This is because of over parameterization which makes use of implicit regularization </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="performance">performance</h1>
<ul>
<li>We find highly-statistically significant slopes and strong explanatory power (R2 between 29% and 68%) for all benchmarks except machine translation, English to German, where we have very little variation in the computing power used. </li>
<li>Object detection, named-entity recognition and machine translation show large increases in hardware burden with relatively small improvements</li>
<li>polynomial models best explain this data, but that models implying an exponential increase in computing power as the right functional form are also plausible.</li>
<li>more-optimistic model, it is estimated to take an additional 10^5× more computing to get to an error rate of 5% for ImageNet.</li>
<li>fundamental rearchitecting is needed to lower the computational intensity</li>
<li>For deep learning, these included mostly GPU and TPU implementations, although it has increasingly also included FPGA and other ASICs.</li>
<li>analog hardware with in-memory computation, neuromorphic computing, optical computing , and quantum computing based approaches [90], as well as hybrid approaches</li>
<li>quantum computing is the approach with perhaps the most long-term upside</li>
<li>pruning” away weights ,quantizing the network, or using low-rank compression are important </li>
<li>overhead of doing meta learning or neural architecture search is itself computationally intense</li>
<li>move to other, perhaps as yet undiscovered or underappreciated types of machine learning.</li>
<li>era when improvements in hardware perfor- mance are slowing. </li>
