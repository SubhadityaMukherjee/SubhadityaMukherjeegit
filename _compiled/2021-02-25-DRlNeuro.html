- Botvinick, M., Wang, J. X., Dabney, W., Miller, K. J., &amp; Kurth-Nelson, Z. (2020). Deep Reinforcement Learning and Its Neuroscientific Implications. Neuron. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03750">Paper</a></p>
<h1 id="introduction">introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li>using deep reinforcement learning it is now possible for brain science to have a new set of research tools</li>
<li>a relationship between deep reinforcement learning and brain function was identified</li>
<li>turns out that neural networks are a good model of neural representation. </li>
<li>Multiple small neural networks with handcrafted structures can actually provide good models of how the brain regions interact to guide a decision making and eventually learning</li>
<li>meta reinforcement learning is basically training a recurrent deep reinforcement learning networks with forced choice decision tasks of interrelated types which allows the network to adapt to new tasks without changing existing weights</li>
<li>to make decisions under risk, It is essential to account for distribution and uncertainty of rewards</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="representation-learning">representation learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>representation learning is basically a reward based learning which shapes internal representations which help to influence later decision making based on reward. </li>
<li>in the brain, visual stimuli is represented in the prefrontal cortex based on which task the animal performs and this also affects neural responses.</li>
<li>This kind of rewards are generally sparse which might lead to overfitting</li>
<li>a sort of solution is to use So supervised learning or unsupervised which also allows the ability to transfer learn</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="model-based-reinforcement-learning">model-based reinforcement learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>sometimes it is possible for systems using model free RL to have behavior and processes resembling model based systems</li>
<li>The attempt is to find out the balance between them</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="memory">memory</h1>
<ul>
<li>experience replay seems to be similar to the replay events which are absorbed in the brain but are non-uniform as compared to systems in the computer</li>
<li>aside from online decision making, episodeic memory as well as maintenance and retrieval and consolidation is also important</li>
<li>working memory maintenance in regarding neural networks seems to be similar to that of neuroscience</li>
<li>attention also seems to be important</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="exploration">exploration</h1>
<ul>
<li>might I love agents to learn or evolve their own motivations based on experience</li>
<li>Even if changes in weights are suspended, metal learning would allow activation dynamics that support</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="cognition">cognition</h1>
<ul>
<li>heirarchical systems can actually operate at time scales with different levels</li>
<li>social cognition such as competitive team games as well as multiple agents being trained in parallel also might emulate the brain</li>
<li>since human learners bring a lifetime of experience for every problem the AI system cannot hope to match up yet</li>
<li>a long-term credit assignment is important</li>
<li>back propagation itself might not allow preserving very old learning when there is new information available</li>
<li>majority of the research is not being done to copy the brain but attempt to recreate it in some other way</li>
<li>neuroscience and deep learning has been connected for decades and reinforcement learning seems to be a good place to continue that learning</li>
