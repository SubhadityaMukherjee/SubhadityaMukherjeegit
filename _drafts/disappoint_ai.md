A naive child wandering in the world finds magic. And then the doubt sets in. His powers fail, his energy vanishes. Will he find his magic again? Or will he be lost again?

Among the infinite stream of knowledge that is available to us humans, some bits seem particularly like magic. The concept of AI was one such spell for me. It's been a few years now, barely anything honestly, but I feel like after a while, magic loses it's charm.
